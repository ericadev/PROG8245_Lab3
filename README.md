## Synopsis

Please see my Lab #3, which demonstrates connecting to a free cloud SQL database, collecting, cleaning, transforming, and scaling real data using Python, conducting EDA, and creating visualizations.

## Quickstart

Please begin by setting up a virtual environment and then running all cells in the Jupyter Notebook in sequence. To create your own virtual environment run the following code in the root directory:

`python -m venv venv`

The installation requirements are in the first cell of the notebook.

## Data-sources

The data was generated and populated using a generator script to create employee records.
